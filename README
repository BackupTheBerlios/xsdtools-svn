xsdtools is a tool for converting xsd-schematas to SQL schemata and to hibernate's mapping files.

There are two binaries:
	xsd2sql provides converting xsd-schemata to SQL.
	xsd2hbm provides converting xsd-schemata to hibernate's mapping files.

xsd2sql has following parameters:
	--xsd, -x        Point to the xsd-file
	--individual, -i Generate individual table for pointed entity.

The "-i" flag provides possibility to create a `symlinks` for types.
I.e. there is a type `SystemParameter` (code: int, description: text) which is used for several sense.
Patient (name: text, marital: SystemParameter, infection: SystemParameter)
It will be better have different description for marital and infection fields.
Those command "xsd2sql -x schemata.xsd -i SystemParameter" creates an own table for storing values of marital and infection.

	--list, -l       List of tables

xsd2hbm has following parameters:
	--xsd, -x        Point to the xsd-file
	--individual, -i Generate indivual class for pointed entity
	--hbm, -b        Generate .hbm.xml files for pointed table
	--list, -l       List of classes
